## *Problem 1*

Importing penguin dataset:

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The dataset `penguins` is a data frame consisting of information
regarding species, their residing islands, sex, their bill’s length and
depth, flipper’s length, body-mass index, sex and the year the data was
collected. These data are provided by the individual variable columns
`species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex`
and `year`respectively. Among them, `species`, `island` and `sex` are
factor variables, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g` and `year` are
integers, and `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` are numeric
variables. There are 344 rows/observations and 8 columns. The mean
flipper length for penguins is 200.92 mm.

Making a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x):

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot_flipper_length_vs_bill_length.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

## *Problem 2*

Creating a dataframe with 10 observations with a random sample variable
from a normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements
of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector and a factor vector
with 3 levels:

``` r
example_df <- tibble(
  sample_var = rnorm(10), 
  log_var = sample_var > 0, 
  char_var = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "b", "a", "c", "d", "f", "g"), 
  factor_var = factor(c("NY", "NJ", "NY", "MA", "MA", "MA", "NY", "NY", "NJ", "NJ"))
)
```

Trying to calculate and outputting mean for each variable:

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, sample_var))
```

    ## [1] 0.1544121

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, log_var))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, char_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, char_var)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, factor_var))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(example_df, factor_var)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Here, we are able to calculate mean for `sample_var` and `log_var`. In
terms of the logical vector `log_var`, it considers `FALSE` and `TRUE`
as 0 and 1 respectively to calculate the mean. We get a NA value and
warning for `char_var` and `factor_var` as they are not numeric or
binary variables.

If we coerce them to be a numeric value as shown below:

``` r
mean(pull(example_df, as.numeric(sample_var)))
mean(pull(example_df, as.numeric(log_var)))
mean(pull(example_df, as.numeric(char_var)))
mean(pull(example_df, as.numeric(factor_var)))
```

This will also calculate the mean for `char_var` and `factor_var` as NA.
Because we are forcing variable to be numeric and the inherently
character values in these two variables cannot be converted to a numeric
type, they will all be considered missing values (NAs). As a result, the
mean for these variable with be NA, and we will get a warning message.
